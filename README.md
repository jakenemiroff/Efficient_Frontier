# efficient frontier

In this project I built an efficient frontier model in python making use of the yfinance API. This model generates 50,000 portfolios containing different weightings of an inputted list of stock tickers.

The goal of the efficient frontier is to maximize portfolio returns while minimizing portfolio risk, otherwise known as maximizing the sharpe ratio.

If you would like to learn more about the theory, these two links were extremely helpful.
